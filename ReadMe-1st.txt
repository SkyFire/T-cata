Thanx for checking out T'CATA - (A Php SkyFire/Cataclysm Database Editor project)

- INSTALLATION:
    Create a folder anywhere on your server
    Extract contents to that folder
    RENAME CONFIG.PHP.DIST -> CONFIG.PHP
    Edit the CONFIG.PHP to match your server/database settings
    Done

- NOTES:
    This is an ongoing private php project of mine. It is subject to errors. I have
    written this in the most easiest form of php so that anyone, even with very 
    little php skills should be able to fumble through it.

    IF YOU MAKE CHANGES TO THE CODE, please send me a copy. If acepted, I will release
    it with your name displayed on the actual page for credit.

    Please leave any credit information intact, so that others can contact me if
    they are having issues.

    I go at my own pace - unless you are making a donation, and then I will work faster 
    on what ever section you want done (usually within 24hrs - 48hrs).
