Thanx for checking out T'CATA - (A Php SkyFire/Cataclysm Database Editor project)

- INSTALLATION:
    Create a folder anywhere on your server
    Extract contents to that folder
    Start the site up.
    If it is your first time, I made an installer to create the config.php however,
    you can edit yourself in the includes/config.php.dist - just don't forget to 
    rename it.
    You must be able to write open/close text files in php. If not, you will have to dig
    through the code and remark that stuff out.

- NOTES:
    This is an ongoing private php project of mine. It is subject to errors. I have
    written this in the most easiest form of php so that anyone, even with very 
    little php skills should be able to fumble through it. So if you use it, no flaming
    or complaining. its FREE!!!

    IF YOU MAKE CHANGES TO THE CODE, please send me a copy. If acepted, I will release
    it with your name displayed on the actual page for credit.

    Please leave any credit information intact, so that others can contact me if
    they are having issues.

    I go at my own pace - unless you are making a donation, and then I will work faster 
    on what ever section you want done (usually within 24hrs - 48hrs).
